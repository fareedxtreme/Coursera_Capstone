INTRODUCTION

Riyadh, the heart of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has seen exponential growth in the past few years. It is the business hub of the country attracting investors, tourists and jobseekers alike, all looking for an opportunity to make their mark. However, finding a decent restaurant can be a nightmare within the 1972 km2 area of the city. Fast-food and various restaurants are always available in any high street; however, you can never be sure about the cuisine they have to offer unless some research is done.

In this exercise, the aim is to have a simple recommendation to let the user have an idea of which districts is best suited for specific cuisines. This will not only help tourists but will also help me as I recently moved to Riyadh and yet to discover great Turkish and Indian Cuisines.
